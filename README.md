# MY PYTHON JOURNEY

__Want to learn Python by writing code yourself?__

Welcome to my Python journey repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Python examples that I've solved during my learning process. All examples are sourced from [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples), a fantastic resource for Python enthusiasts.


## Introduction
The best way to learn Python is by practicing examples. This page contains examples on basic concepts of Python. We encourage you to try these examples on your own before looking at the solution.

This repository serves as a showcase of my progress in Python programming. Each example is a testament to the skills I've acquired and challenges I've overcome.

## Getting Started
To run these examples locally, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository, navigate to the specific example directory, and run the Python script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RahulP-Here/my-python-journey.git
cd my-python-journey
python example_name.py
```
